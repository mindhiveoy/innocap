# Code of Conduct

## Why

INNOCAP is an open source project. We want a friendly, professional, and harassment-free environment for everyone who participates—users, contributors, and maintainers.

## What

This Code of Conduct defines:

- **Expected behaviour** in our community spaces
- **Unacceptable behaviour** we will not tolerate
- **How to report** concerns safely and privately
- **How enforcement works** when issues occur

## How

### Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- **Be respectful and empathetic**: assume good intent, communicate clearly, and listen actively.
- **Be constructive**: give actionable feedback, focus on the work, and help others learn.
- **Be inclusive**: make space for different perspectives and experiences.
- **Be responsible**: own mistakes, apologise when appropriate, and correct issues promptly.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- **Harassment and discrimination**: offensive comments, slurs, targeted hostility, or exclusionary behaviour.
- **Threats and violence**: intimidation, encouraging harm, or doxxing.
- **Sexual content or advances**: unwelcome sexual attention, sexualised language, or imagery.
- **Disruption**: sustained derailment, trolling, or intentionally obstructing collaboration.
- **Privacy violations**: sharing private information without consent.

### Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (including pull requests, issues, comments, commits, and other contributions) that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories, pull requests, issues, discussions, and code reviews
- Project communication channels used for coordination and support
- Public spaces when an individual is representing the project (for example, in a talk, post, or discussion)

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it privately to the project maintainers.

- **Primary contact**: use the contact method listed in `SECURITY.md` under **Contact**.
- **If you are in immediate danger**: contact your local emergency services.

When making a report, please include (if possible):

- **What happened**: a description of the incident
- **Where it happened**: links, screenshots, or other context
- **When it happened**: timestamps and timezone if known
- **Who was involved**: usernames/handles and any witnesses
- **Any additional details**: prior context or relevant history

We will respect your privacy and handle reports with discretion. We may ask follow-up questions to understand what happened and determine an appropriate response.

### Enforcement guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences:

1. **Correction**
   - **Community impact**: use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - **Consequence**: a private, written warning with clarification of expectations.

2. **Warning**
   - **Community impact**: a single incident or series of actions that violates standards, with moderate disruption.
   - **Consequence**: a private warning with stated consequences for continued behaviour.

3. **Temporary ban**
   - **Community impact**: serious violation of standards, including sustained harassment or repeated disruptive behaviour.
   - **Consequence**: a temporary ban from interacting with the project for a specified period.

4. **Permanent ban**
   - **Community impact**: pattern of violations, severe harassment, threats, or other behaviour that makes participation unsafe.
   - **Consequence**: permanent removal from the community spaces of the project.
